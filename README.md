# Rock-Paper-Scissor 
This is the first javascript project is done by me.
This project runs only in developer console.
Followed Odin Project's lesson Problem-Solving approach to finish this game.
The Problem solving approach and pseudocode to solve this written below.

I. Understanding the problem of this project.
    The game is played by two players. The basic principle of this game is 
    Rock beats Scissor.
    Scissor beats Paper.
    Paper beats Rock.
    And last part is to display how many times each player has won.

II. Plan.
    The game is played in a console. Only one user and the user play against the computer.
    The main input here is to get the input from the user. 
    The second input is by computer which returns randomly.
    The desired output is to show who is beaten by who and to show their score.
    After getting user inputs we will use function and logics to display the desired output.

III. Pseusocode. (Algorithm)
    1. Get the user input and store it in a variable.
    2. Get the computer input using random function and store it in a variable. Here use if-else        
       condition or switch-case to get the input. Example in math random function initialize the number to 2 (Multiply by 2) each time when this function works and returns a random integer 0, 1 or 2. If 0 then it is return rock, if it is 1 then return paper and so on.
    3. Next is to match the user input and computer input if both are same display tie. Or display who 
       wins.(If else condition and logical operators).
    4. Next use a loop to show how many times user won and how many time computer won.
